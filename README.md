# Predict-Loan-Repayment
### Business Problem:

A fictional fintech company called SwiftBank provides banking services to its consumers through its mobile app.
The product team is looking to launch a new financial product to allow users to “buy now and pay later”.
To access this product, users need to qualify for a small loan. The product manager wants you to build a model that can be used to evaluate the risk of a user based on their financial profile.
